# Create and/or commit to a git branch

If we are in the 'main', 'master', or 'develop' branch, create a new branch. Name it based on the user input (if provided), otherwise name it based upon the changes. Then add any uncommited changes to the new branch. If you created a new branch, switch to it to make it the current branch.

If we are already in a branch that is not 'main', 'master', or 'develop', just add any uncommited changes to the current branch.
