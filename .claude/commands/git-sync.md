# Sync the default git branch

Take note of any changes in the current active branch that have not been checked-in as we may move these to a different branch in the next step.

If we are not in the default branch, move any unchecked-in changes from the active branch into the default branch, but do not check them in. Switch to the default branch of the repository to make it the current active branch (if it is not already).

When we are in the default branch, and any unchecked-in changes from the previous branch have been moved to the default branch, pull any outstanding changes from remote into the default branch to bring to update it.
